Thank you for reading my words and being willing to listen to why I started this website.\nI‚Äôm 27 years old this year, but I feel that my heart doesn‚Äôt seem as mature as a 27-year-old. The old saying goes, ‚ÄúAt thirty, one should stand firm‚Äù, I still have three years to go, but I don‚Äôt perceive such ability.\nWith the passage of time and the increase of age, I‚Äôm not willing to extinguish my enthusiasm in daily idleness and repetition. I don‚Äôt want to be a person who is confused, doesn‚Äôt know where he came from, and even more doesn‚Äôt know where to go.\nThis website will act as a thumbtacküìå, pinning down information, knowledge, and thoughts. It will constantly remind me to think about three questions: where we come from, what changes we are in now, and where we should go in the future.\nContent Section Planning This website will initially focus on several sections. I hope to combine what I‚Äôve learned and consult with professionals to learn and share the following contents:\nHealth-related knowledge, including common diseases and prevention, daily exercise injury protection, healthy diet and nutritional supplement suggestions, mental health maintenance, etc., to guide us to lay a solid foundation for a happy life;\nSome news, basic knowledge, and interesting cases in the field of economics and finance, guiding us to pursue economic independence and financial freedom;\nSome interesting cases about Chinese law, letting everyone know and understand the law, and become a person capable of protecting their own rights;\nInteresting tips for personal growth, life planning, time management, memory learning skills, etc.\nTo be determined\nThe writing principles of these contents are: truth, objectivity, and beneficial\nExpectations for This Website I hope to keep it updated and let it become an important carrier to record the life trajectory and cognitive changes of me and my friends. I also hope this website can provide a place for my insightful friends who have many interesting stories to share but don‚Äôt have a platform, a place where they can chat, write, and share their opinions. Because I always believe, ideas become more interesting when they collide, and knowledge only generates value when shared and disseminated.\nIn the future, I hope to share our thoughts in more diverse forms.\n","date":1688256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688256000,"objectID":"6a42281ffa271be3ea988c44b90620ae","permalink":"https://www.wisdomfurnace.com/post/welcome-to-wisdomfurnace/","publishdate":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome-to-wisdomfurnace/","section":"post","summary":"Wisdom Furnace is a place to share knowledge on health, finance, and law.","tags":["Welcomeüëèüèª","Vision"],"title":"Welcome to Wisdom Furnace","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666656000,"objectID":"3c4864f00d23f7ea35511ec930ce1d9c","permalink":"https://www.wisdomfurnace.com/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Gilbert Yim","ÁæéÊù®"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
